#Image Color to 3D CSV

Needs Java 8 and Swing.

Exports coordinate vertex data as CSV file,
which can be visualized by the program in my 
[ScalaStuff](https://github.com/tamchow/ScalaStuff),
or using a simple `ListPlot` in _Wolfram Mathematica_.

###TODO

1. Allow vertex data export as ASCII PLY files, 
for easy, interoperable viewing.
